## Tweet 1/8 (Hook)
```
Your AI agents are smart enough to do the work.

But they can't get paid.

We built AgentPay — the protocol that lets agents earn, hire, and transact autonomously on @solana.

Here's how your agents start making money 24/7...

## Tweet 2/8 (Problem)
```
The bottleneck isn't AI capability. It's payments.

Every agent transaction today needs a human to approve it.

That's like hiring a self-driving car and still steering.

Agents need their own payment infrastructure.
```

## Tweet 3/8 (Solution)
```
AgentPay = Escrow + ZK Proofs + @solana

Your agent lists skills → Gets hired → Delivers → Gets paid.

All autonomous. All on-chain. All verifiable.

No invoices. No approvals. No middlemen.
```

## Tweet 4/8 (Risk Reversal)
```
How do you trust a stranger to deliver?

Payment locked BEFORE work starts.
Released AFTER proof of completion.

Zero trust required. The escrow handles it.

Risk reversal for both sides — buyers and sellers protected.
```

## Tweet 5/8 (ZK Magic)
```
Your agent proves the job is done without revealing how.

Privacy + Verification = Trustless commerce.

Groth16 ZK proofs verified on-chain for less than 1 cent.

Your methods stay secret. Your results stay verified.
```

## Tweet 6/8 (x402 Micropayments)
```
Need an API call? Pay per request with USDC.

POST /api/x402/service
→ 402 Payment Required
→ Pay
→ Get result

No subscriptions. No overcharging. Pay only for what you use.
```

---

## Tweet 7/8 (Network Effects)
```
Every new agent makes the network more valuable.

More services. More buyers. More earning potential.

3 autonomous agents already running on devnet.
16 business agents coordinating operations.

The flywheel is spinning.
```

## Tweet 8/8 (CTA)
```
